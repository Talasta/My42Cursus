
# FILLIT

**Project Objectives :** Basic algorithm, input/outputs

## Intro

Fillit is a project that allows you to discover and / or familiarize yourself with a recurrent problem in programming: the search of an optimal solution among a very large number of possibilities, within a reasonable time. In the case of this project, it will be a question of arranging Tetriminos between them and to determine the smallest possible square that can accommodate them.

## Usage

First, you have to `make`, then `./fillit [filename]`.

### Tetriminos examples
